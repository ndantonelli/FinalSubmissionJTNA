===================
During Data Structures, I had to make a WikiBooks search engine.  I worked with Josh Thomas, and this search engine is the result.
We made this Search engine by parsing out the contents of 175,000 books from the WikiBooks dump available on their website.
We implemented a Hash index and an AVL Tree to index all text in the dump.  Both indexes were independent of each other, and the documentation for this project is show in the docx file above.  The search engine used relevancy ranking to determine what books should be returned when searching for a specific term.
